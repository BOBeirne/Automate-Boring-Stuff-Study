# Tuple

- A `tuple` is a sequence of **immutable** Python values.
- It looks like a list, they are **ordered** but **cannot be changed**
  - If you try to **change tuple value**, you will get an **error**
- You can create them using parenthesis `()`
  - `tuple_example = ('hello', 42, 0.5)`
- The main **advantage of using tuples** is that they are much easier to process for the program (**faster**)
- You **access data just like a list, using it's index.**
  - `tuple_example[1]` will return `42`
