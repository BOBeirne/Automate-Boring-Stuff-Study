You've seen what Python can do. Now go deeper.

This workbook transforms Al Sweigart's best-selling guide from a reading experience into a coding experience.
Following Automate the Boring Stuff with Python chapter by chapter, this workbook will help you turn concepts into
muscle memory through carefully designed exercises, projects, and real Python scripts.

Every concept from Automate is reinforced through carefully sequenced questions, exercises, and projects that help you
think like a programmer and prove to yourself that you really get it.

At the end of each chapter, you'll tackle miniprojects that bring everything together. Whether you're renaming files,
scraping websites, converting text to speech, modifying spreadsheets, or sending emails, you'll build scripts that do real
work. Fun projects like image generators and word games are in the mix too, not just boring stuff.

Every question and project come with a solution at the back of the book, so you're never stuck.
Inside, you'll find:

© Fill-in-the-blank and short-answer questions that reinforce key concepts

Targeted exercises to build fluency with variables, loops, functions, regular expressions, and more
Real Python scripts to run, tweak, and debug
Projects that automate common tasks like organizing files, backing up data, and scheduling programs

Full working code for every project so you can check your work and learn by example

With over 500,000 copies sold worldwide, Automate the Boring Stuff with Python has become the go-to guide for
learning Python. This workbook gives you the structure, feedback, and smart reinforcement to go from reading code to
writing it with confidence.
