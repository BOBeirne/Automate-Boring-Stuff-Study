# Write a function printtable() that takes list of lists of strings and displays them in well organized table

             ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol', 'david'],

# Hint: Your code will first have to find the longest string in each of the inner lists so that the whole column 
# can be wide enough to fit all the strings. 

# You can store the maximum width of each column as a list of integers. 

# The printTable() function can begin with colWidths = [0] * len(tableData), 
# which will create a list containing the same number of 0 values as the number of inner lists in tableData. 

# That way, colWidths[0] can store the width of the longest string in tableData[0], 
# colWidths[1] can store the width of the longest string in tableData[1], and so on. 
# You can then find the largest value in the colWidths list to find out what integer width to pass to the rjust() string method.
