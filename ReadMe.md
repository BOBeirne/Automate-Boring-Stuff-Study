This repository is a documentation of my personal journey to learn programming in Python using book "Automate The Boring Stuff With Python (3rd Edition)" by Al Sweigart.


- All notes contain personally written notes by me in the Markdown format, compatible with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/),
- 99% of notes are based on the book, however you may find some extra notes for additional module features I have discovered while working on exercise programs,
- Code snippets and projects are mostly following the book examples by Al, however some of them I have slightly modified for my own needs,
- You may find a few code changes in programs compared to the ones in the book written by Al, either due to them refusing to run for me or for eg. example website HTML/CSS changes that also require code adjustment,
- All exercise programs are fully handwritten by me with an occasional help from AI or Python Discord server members for debugging,
- No Vibe coding has been used in this repo, some autocompletion has been used to speed up the note taking.
- IDE I am using is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
