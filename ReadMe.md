#### This repository is a documentation of my **personal journey to learn programming in Python** using book "Automate The Boring Stuff With Python (3rd Edition)" by Al Sweigart.

##### Notes:

- All notes contain **personally written notes** by me in the Markdown format,
- Autocompletion has been used to speed up the note taking in md files, but they all have been reviewed prior to accepting, if accepted,
- Index is **compatible with** [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/),
- 99% of notes are based on the book, however you may find **some extra notes** for additional modules or module features I have discovered while working on exercise programs and debugging,

##### Code:

- You may find a **few code changes in projects or snippets** compared to the ones in the book written by Al, either due to them refusing to run for me or for eg. example website HTML/CSS changes
- All exercise programs are **fully handwritten by me with an occasional help from AI Chat** helping me explain parts of the book / module features I had trouble fully understanding or **Discord's Python server members** advice,
- **IDE** I am using is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

You can **support Al** by buying his book or you can [Read it for free here](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/).
